  \resumeSubItem{CLI tool for React Projects}{Setting up a new front-end project is cumbersome and time consuming. Therefore, as a senior developer and a prospective leader, I found it of utmost importance to create a CLI tool that would generate the boilerplate version of app. With intense brainstorming, extensive research and an explicit review of large scale projects, I and other senior developers were able to decide the structure and base architecture for React projects. Once the architecture was finalized I developed the CLI to create components and base structure dynamically. This reduced the set-up time for new frontend projects drastically from initial 3 hours to only 30 minutes.}
